#  DLND Image Classification

### The second project of the [_**Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)


In this project we built a network to classify images in the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The dataset contains 60K color images (32Ã—32 pixel) in 10 classes, with 6K images per class.

The project was implemented in Python and using Numby and Tensorflow.

#### Topics covered are:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- TensorFlow
- Max pooling
- Dropout
- AWS
